# browser_crypto_mine
This is an extension that should give users control about the cryptomining preformed on their browser.

I published it, because a. I hope that browser based cryptomining will become the new micropayment method on the web(instead of tracking), b. I wanted to present my programming skills to potential customers to potential customers, c. I've accepted a job with a clausule in it about my intellectual property that is unclear, so I'm safing all my previously written code I'm willing to just share with the rest of the world without compensation by wrapping it in a restrictive license, so I can at least keep developing and publishing it, due to automatic license restrictions.
